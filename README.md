# Abstract Syntax Forestry

An EmberConf 2020 workshop from [simplabs](https://simplabs.com/) to teach you
the basics about Abstract Syntax Trees.


## ![Slide 1](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.001.png)

Hello everyone and welcome to this workshop which I titled "Abstract Syntax
Forestry".

Since probably not everyone doing this workshop is a native speaker and
immediately understands this word play, let's quickly start with an intro
about what that title means.


## ![Slide 2](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.002.png)

First of all, what does "Forestry" mean?

Any idea?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry):

> **Forestry** is the science and craft of creating, managing, using,
conserving, and repairing forests, woodlands, and associated resources for human
and environmental benefits.

or in other words:


## ![Slide 3](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.003.png)

**Forestry** means: working with trees!


## ![Slide 4](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.004.png)

now... what is a **tree**?


## ![Slide 5](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.005.png)

This is a **tree**!

But it's not the kind of tree we want to talk about in this workshop... 


## ![Slide 6](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.006.png)

There is a certain type of data structure that is also called **tree**, because
depending on how you look at it, it roughly looks like a real tree. And some
other terminology (aka. words) also are borrowed from this metaphor. The
**tree** data structure has **leaf** elements, it has **branches** and it has a
**root** elements.

About that... what defines a **tree** data structure?


## ![Slide 7](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.007.png)

First of all, a **tree** is a **graph** data structure, but a specific kind of
graph. The defining features are that a tree has exactly **one root element**
(at the top here), and that element can have 0, 1, 2, 1000, or even more, child
elements. And then each of those child elements can also have an arbitrary
number of child elements.

But, a child element can only ever have one parent element!

If you need something else to compare against: it is very roughly like a
recursive `belongsTo` relationship in Ember Data or any other relational
database/ORM kind of system.

Now that we have a rough understanding of what a **tree** is in theory, let's
get into a few real examples of where the **tree** data structure is being used.

Any ideas?

(yes, I realize that in this format you've likely already had a glimpse of the
next slide ðŸ˜…)


## ![Slide 8](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.008.png)

One example of a **tree** structure that we use all the time is: JSON.

JSON has a very limited number of data types and arrays and objects are the
only ones that can have children. An array can have 0, 1, 1000, or more
elements in it. And an object can also have 0, 1, 1000, or more keys with
their associated values in it.

And then there is the constraint of having a single root element. If you look
at a JSON file, you can see that it always either has a single object or array
as the main element in the file, and if you try to put a second thing in the
file it will result in a syntax error.

That means, similar to how trees are a specific kind of **graph** data
structure, we can consider JSON to be a specific kind of **tree** data
structure.


## ![Slide 9](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.009.png)

Another real-world example is HTML. In HTML you have the root `<html>` element,
and that can have multiple children, though in reality it only supports `<head>`
and `<body>`. But those then can also have an arbitrary number of child
elements.


## ![Slide 10](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.010.png)

You can see on the right side of the above slide how the tree structure of
the HTML file on the left side could be represented.

If you feel reminded of the DOM (document object model) in the browser, that is
no coincidence. The browser also parses the HTML file into such a tree
structure and then exposes it to JavaScript as the DOM.


## ![Slide 11](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.011.png)

So far we've only been talking about **trees**. But what about the other two
words in that workshop title? what does "abstract syntax" mean?


## ![Slide 12](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.012.png)

In a very basic way, an "Abstract Syntax Tree" is a JSON object that
represents the code structure of a file.

As you can see in the slide, I've put asterisks (`*`) on the words "JSON" and
"code", because...


## ![Slide 13](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.013.png)

While most parsers in the JavaScript ecosystem produce JSON-based ASTs, there
are quite a few parsers in other ecosystems that don't use JSON. Since this
workshop assumes that most of you are working primarily with JavaScript we will
focus on JSON-based ASTs here for now.

Please note that the general concept will still be roughly the same, whether
the parser produces JSON, or not.


## ![Slide 14](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.014.png)

The other asterisk was on "code". Because while ASTs are mostly used for code
there are also some other file parsers that can produce ASTs.

Take our earlier example of HTML. HTML is a subset of XML, and XML can be used
for regular data files. But a lot of HTML parsers that produce ASTs can handle
XML, so you can easily convert an XML data file into an AST.

But enough of all this theoretical talk, let's look at an example!


## ![Slide 15](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.015.png)

There is a great tool on the internet that I would like to introduce you to,
and it's called **AST Explorer**.

You can find it at <https://astexplorer.net>.

If you've never opened it before it will start you on the default view,
with an example JavaScript file on the left side, and the corresponding
syntax tree on the right side.

You can notice that when you click on something in the left panel it will
automatically focus the corresponding syntax tree element in the right panel,
and similarly, if you hover over something in the right panel it highlights
the corresponding characters on the left. (if it does not do that, check if you
have the "Autofocus" checkbox enabled on the right side of the screen)

Where it gets interesting is when you move your cursor over the "JavaScript"
button in the menu bar at the top. Here, you should see a dropdown menu of all
the available languages that the AST Explorer understands. If you look closely,
you can see that it also supports **Handlebars**, which is what we will be
focusing on for this first bit of the workshop.

If you click on "Handlebars" you will see that the snippet in the left panel
has changed to a small example template, and the right panel is now also
showing something different: the Handlebars syntax tree.

In case you're wondering "where is the JSON that we talked about?", have a look
at the "Tree | JSON" tab bar on the right side of the screen. If you click on
"JSON" you can see the raw JSON data, while the "Tree" view shows a slightly
more ergonomic view of the same data.


## ![Slide 16](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.016.png)

Let's start with the first exercise!

I invite you to click around a bit in the AST Explorer and when you feel
comfortable try to answer the three questions above.

If you don't know what an **element modifier** is I would recommend to first
have a look at the [Ember.js Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/template-lifecycle-dom-and-modifiers/)
that explain what they are and what they can be used for.

To get started you can modify the example template on the left side of the
screen to match the snippet below:

```hbs
<div class="entry">
  <h1>{{title}}</h1>
  <div class="body">
    {{body}}
  </div>
  <button type="button" {{on "click" this.onNext}}>Next</button>
</div>
```

<details>
 <summary>Solution 1</summary>

> what is the node type of and element modifier in handlebars templates?

To solve this first exercise we need to click on the `on` in 
`{{on "click" this.onNext}}`, which will focus a `PathExpression` element in the
AST. You can see that this `PathExpression` belongs to the `path` attribute of
the parent element and that element has the `type` attribute
`ElementModifierStatement`

And that is already the answer to our first question "what is the node type of
and element modifier in handlebars templates?":

The node `type` of an element modifier is `ElementModifierStatement`
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Solution 2</summary>

> what other attributes does a modifier have?

For this question we keep our focus on the `ElementModifierStatement` node in
the AST. We've already seen that the element has a `type`
(`ElementModifierStatement`) and a `path` (a `PathExpression` with `on`), but
there are also some other attributes here:

- `params` holds a list of all the positional parameters (`"click"` and
  `this.onNext` in this case).

- `hash` holds information about named parameters. for example the [`on`
  modifier](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/3.17/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/on?anchor=on)
  that we're using in this example supports a named parameter called `passive`,
  that can be used like this: `{{on "click" this.onNext passive=true}}`

Depending on the state of the "Hide location data" checkbox in the AST Explorer
you can also see a `loc` attribute. This attribute tells us where in the
template file this AST node starts and ends. This information is for example
used by the AST Explorer to highlight the correct characters when we hover over
the nodes in the panel on the right side.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Solution 3</summary>

> how are modifiers assigned to their parent node?

To answer this last question of the exercise we need to look at the parent node
of our `ElementModifierStatement`. You can see that the
`ElementModifierStatement` node is part of an array, which makes sense, because
an element in Handlebars can have multiple modifiers at the same time.

That array of element modifiers is assigned to the `modifiers` key of the
`ElementNode` parent element, and that is already the answer that we're looking
for: `modifiers`.
</details>

## ![Slide 17](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.017.png)

Alright, after this first exercise let's see what all this is actually useful
for.

Any ideas? 

## ![Slide 21](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.021.png)

Asking this without you seeing the answer already on the next slide would
obviously work much better, but let's pretend that someone in the room had
raised their hand and answered one or more of these things... ðŸ˜‰

There are generally three categories of tools that we can build using ASTs.

The first category is **code analysis tools**. Basically tools that parse code files
into ASTs and then analyze the code via the AST. Some tools might analyze the
code directly as characters, but it is usually waaay easier if you can work with
the code in a more structured way.

The second category are **compilers**. These kinds of tools take your code, parse
it, convert it into something different that a machine can execute and then
write it out again.

Don't worry if this sounds complicated or abstract, we'll get to some example
in just a few seconds... depending on how fast you can read... ðŸ˜„

The third category can be named **refactoring** tools, or sometimes also
referred to as **codemods**. These tools read your code, adjust it in some way
and write it out again.

## ![Slide 22](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.022.png)

At this point you might be thinking: "wait, the second and third category sound
almost the same... what's the difference?"

And you are absolutely correct that the lines are a little blurry here.

## ![Slide 23](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.023.png)

The main difference between the two categories is that compilation tools write
the output in a way that is optimized for machines to read it, with often a lot
of optimizations that make the resulting code quite unreadable.

Refactoring tools however try to keep the output as close to the input as
possible, so that the developers are still able to read the code in an easy way.

## ![Slide 24](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.024.png)

I promised you examples, so let's go through all three of these categories and
find a few examples.

As you can see the slide above is blank again, which is usually the trigger for
you to come up with a few answers yourself before we continue.

...

...

...

Alright, let's see what our example list has on it.

## ![Slide 25](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.025.png)

The most famous code analysis tool in the JavaScript ecosystem right now is
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

Something similar also exists to analyze CSS and SASS files and it is called
[stylelint](https://stylelint.io/).

And then we also have a bunch of code analysis tools from the Ember.js ecosystem
specifically, like [ember-template-lint](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/),
the [Ember Language Server](https://github.com/emberwatch/ember-language-server),
and [ember-intl-analyzer](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-intl-analyzer).


## ![Slide 26](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.026.png)

The next category is "Compilation".

One famous compiler is `gcc`, which can be used to turn C and C++ code into
machine code that can run on your computer.

But we want to focus on the JavaScript ecosystem here...

## ![Slide 27](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.027.png)

You probably know it under the name "transpiler" instead of "compiler", but
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) fits our definition quite well. It's mostly called
transpiler because it happens to compile the input language, JavaScript, to
the same output language, JavaScript.

Another example that is again more CSS focused is [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/),
which compiles SASS files to CSS files.

[PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) goes in a similar direction, but here you could
also call it a transpiler since it compiles CSS into CSS.

Another example is [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS), which
compiles JavaScript into minified JavaScript. The code after the compilation
still does the same thing, but it's optimized for machines to execute, and no
longer for humans to read or edit.

And looking more into the Ember.js ecosystem, we have the [Glimmer](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-vm/)
template compiler, which turns our Handlebars templates into code that runs
directly in the browser.


## ![Slide 28](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.028.png)

If we look a little closer here, we can see that a lot of these compilers are
actually built out of a number of smaller plugins that can be enabled or
disabled as we want. This is similar to how you can turn on and off certain
rules in your ESLint or ember-template-lint config files.


## ![Slide 29](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.029.png)

Finally, the last category: Refactoring

If you haven't built a codemod before it's unlikely that you know these tools
so let's jump right to the list of examples.


## ![Slide 30](./assets/abstract-syntax-forestry.030.png)

If you want to build a codemod that modifies JavaScript files then the best
solution is currently [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift),
which is built on top of [recast](https://github.com/benjamn/recast), and gives
it a more jQuery-like API.

For Handlebars templates the awesome [Robert Jackson](https://github.com/rwjblue/)
has built something similar, which is called [ember-template-recast](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-recast).
Something like jscodeshift does not yet exist for it, but I've seen some early
prototypes and the future looks bright! ðŸ˜Š

And then the last tool on this list is something that we've already seen before:
PostCSS

PostCSS is in some sense a special case because it largely preserves the input
formatting by default, but is also regularly used as a transpiler. We won't
focus on PostCSS in this workshop, but if you ever want or need to write a
codemod in the future that needs to touch CSS then I would recommend to have a
look at PostCSS.
